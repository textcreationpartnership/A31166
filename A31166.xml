            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen OF LONDON, UPON The PETITION of ſome of the Common-Council Men, preſented to the Honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> with his Lordſhips and the Aldermens An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Charge exhibited againſt them in the ſaid Petition.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Licens'd</hi> Decemb. 13. 1690.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The firſt Charge in the Petition is,</head>
               <p>THat ſeveral Aldermen now act (who were ſo made by Charter or Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the late King <hi>James</hi>) under ſome doubtful Expreſſions in the late Act of Parliament for reverſing the Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the City.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>That there are now 26 Aldermen, 10 of them were ſo when the ſaid Judgment was given againſt the City, and ſome of them afterwards continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act as Aldermen by Commiſſions from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the <hi>2d. viz.</hi> Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> the firſt Maior by Commiſſion, Sir <hi>John Moore,</hi> Sir <hi>Rob. Jefferies,</hi> Sir <hi>Jonathan Raymond,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Daniel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Rich;</hi> and as for Sir <hi>Rob. Clayton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Lawrence</hi> and Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> who were three of the ſaid ten, they refuſed to Act by any Commiſſion, but do now act as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, all the ſaid ten Aldermen being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Offices by the ſaid late Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>That as to the other 16 Aldermen, 14 of them were after the late K. <hi>James</hi> his Charter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration to the City all choſen by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Wards, according to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, (the Wards for which they were choſen being vacant either by the Deaths or Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Perſons who were Aldermen thereof at the time of the ſaid Judgment) and 2 of the ſaid 16 were choſen according to Cuſtome ſince the ſaid Act of Parliament; ſo that the whole Court of Aldermen, by Vertue of the ſaid Act of Parliament is now ſettled upon their ancient Foundation, and act not by any Commiſſion whatſoever.</p>
               <p>That the Petitioners pretence of ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words in the Act of Parliament, is becauſe it doth not confirm the Aldermen, (duely choſen as aforeſaid) Aldermen being not named in the Act: But this is a meer Cavil without ground; for that all Officers, Miniſters, and Perſons hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Places or Employments in the City are confirm'd in their Places; and an Alderman is as conſiderable an Officer as any in the City, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Mayor) he is a Judicial of the Court of Aldermen and Court of Orphans, by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Oath of an Alderman, he is ſworn to be true to the King and City in the Office of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman; and in all Acts of Parliament where Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen are named, its called the Office of an Alderman, <hi>viz.</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. about Corporations; and in the Writs of <hi>Mandamus</hi> its called the Office of Alderman.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The ſecond Charge.</head>
               <p>That Sir <hi>Tho. Pilkington</hi> was by the ſaid Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on the day of Election appointed by the ſaid Act of Parliament, declared and made Mayor, tho not duely returned by the Common-Hall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtome.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>That it will be proved beyond contradiction, that the Common-Hall was duely call'd, a fair Poll was taken, that the preſent Lord Mayor and Sir <hi>Jonathan Raymond</hi> had the Majority of the Poll, that they two were by the Sheriffs returned to the Court of Aldermen, who according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome did chooſe the preſent Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>That Sir <hi>Robert Adams</hi> and ſome others, after the Poll was cloſed, and while it was caſting up, demanded of the Sheriffs a Scrutiny thereof, which was granted; that afterwards the Sheriffs came into the Common-Hall and declared the Poll, and that a Scrutiny was demanded and granted, and that the next day the Sheriffs ſent to the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Adams,</hi> and the others who demanded the Scrutiny, that the day following they would proceed upon the Scrutiny; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Sheriffs met at the time appointed, and the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Adams</hi> and the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons came, but they refuſed to proceed therein, ſaying, they were ſatisfied with the Declaration the Sheriffs had made of the Poll in the Common-Hall.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may be objected, That there is a By-law, That no Perſon can be Mayor two Years together: Let that whole By-law be read, and it will appear to have been Enacted, that for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charges of that Office, none ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to hold a ſecond Year, (that is, againſt his Will.) But the now Mayor before his laſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had not held the Office for one whole Year, though he had two-pieces of two ſeveral Years, and then the ſaid Act of Parliament happening, he was choſen, not according to Cuſtome, which the ſaid By-law referrs to, but by the ſaid Act of Parliament, which ordains a Mayor to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and to hold for longer than a Year.</p>
               <p>And further, if by the ſaid By-law the laſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the preſent Lord Mayor be pretended void, or that he is unduely elected, and that Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> who was Mayor when the ſaid Judgment was given againſt the City, ought by the ſaid Act of Parliament to be Mayor:</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb facs="tcp:97437:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>Whether this be ſo or not, is only tryable in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and for that purpoſe the ſaid Sir <hi>William Prichard</hi> the laſt <hi>Trinity</hi> Term brought his Writ of <hi>Mandamus</hi> to be admitted to the Office of Mayor, and a Return was made thereto, That the preſent Maior was duely elected according to the ſaid Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which if not true, Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> might have brought, and may ſtill bring his Action, and try the ſaid matter.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Third Charge is,</head>
               <p>That by the Contrivance of the Maior and Aldermen, Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> is impoſed on the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners as Chamberlain, thô another Perſon was duely elected to that Office, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Rich.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>It will be proved, That in the Common Hall, upon view of the Hands, the Sheriffs declared Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> to be choſen; but a Poll was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and granted, and upon the Caſting it up, Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> had the Majority by three: Then a Scrutiny was demanded and granted, and Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> had ſeveral times notice given him to be at the Scrutiny, but he refuſed to come.</p>
               <p>That the Scrutiny of the Poll was afterwards proceeded in, whereby it appeared that there were Fifty whole polled for Sir <hi>Peter Rich,</hi> and Seventeen for Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> that were not Livery men, whereby <hi>Robinſon</hi> had the Majority by 30.</p>
               <p>That Oath being made of all this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court of Aldermen, by their Oaths they could not refuſe the Swearing and admitting the ſaid <hi>Robinſon</hi> Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> looking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf injured, brought his Writ of <hi>Mandamus</hi> to be admitted Chamberlain, to which Writ the Mayor and Aldermen returned, That he was not elected Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> thereupon brought his Action againſt the Lord Mayor in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> for making the ſaid Return; to which he hath appeared, and upon the tryall thereof it will appear whether the ſaid Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> be choſen or not, and if it ſhall be found for him, he will recover his damages; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be a much more Legal method for trying that matter than the Petitioners.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The fourth Charge,</head>
               <p>That divers Members of the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are excluded, and others duely elected are refuſed their Admittances.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>The pretence for this, is, That the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> laſt was the day appointed by the ſaid Act of Parliament for the electing all the Common Council Men of the City: That Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> in <hi>Alderſgate</hi> Ward, and Sir <hi>Tho.

Kenſey</hi> did not ſwear his.</p>
               <p>That complaint being thereof made to the Court of Aldermen, they upon full hearing of the parties on both ſides, and examining ſeveral Witneſſes upon Oath, did adjudge both the ſaid pretended Elections to be void, and that thoſe who were Common Council men at the time of the ſaid Judgment, ought by the ſaid Act of Parliament to ſerve till St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Day next, but many of the Petitioners being met in Common Council, pretended the right to judge of the Election of Common Council men belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Common Council, thô the conſtant uſage and practice, (time out of mind) as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ancient Records, is for the Court of Aldermen to judge thereof; and if theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council-men ſo as aforeſaid excluded, think themſelves prejudiced by the ſaid Judgment of the Court of Aldermen, they may bring their Writs of <hi>Mandamus</hi> to be reſtored.</p>

               <p>That the Petitioners were ſo very clamorous and rude, that they would not ſuffer any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be put about the City's buſineſs; that there was not any thing propoſed by any man to be a pretended doubt in the ſaid Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any matter mentioned as a ground whereupon to put any ſuch Queſtion, nor what words of the Act of Parliament they would have explained.</p>
               <p>That as ſome of the Petitioners made a motion for ſuch a ſenceleſs Queſtion, ſo others oppoſed it, and nothing could be brought to a Queſtion, the heat and noiſe of the Petitioners was ſo great. Nor did the Lord Mayor diſſolve the Court till ſeveral of the Common Council men moved for it. But admit the Petitioners had upon a fair queſtion carried it, That an Addreſs ſhould be made to the Houſe of Commons, to explain the ſaid late Act of Parliament; yet the Mayor and Aldermen (by an Act of Council made the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1683. Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> then Mayor) might have refuſed it, they by that Act having a negative voice upon any thing the Commons ſhall propoſe to them.</p>
